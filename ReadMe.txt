This script was tested to run in Matlab R2022a, with dependencies on the wavelet toolbox.

The main script loads data, performs the necessary computations, and plots out results of both the ridge extraction and the windowed reconstruction

Please ensure the main script, along with both functions (coi and rednoise) are added to your working path, along with the CSV file containing sample snythetic data
